# Without-use-library-function-Minimum-Error-Rate-Classifier
Minimum Error Rate Classifier aims to minimize the total classification error by considering the costs associated with misclassification. It involves assigning each data point to the class that results in the least total cost. The cost matrix specifies the cost of misclassifying one class as another.

Here is the step of performing this task:
1. Classify the sample points from “test.txt”.
2. Classified samples should have different colored markers according to the assigned class label.
3. Draw a figure which should include these points, the corresponding probability distribution function
along with its contour.
4. Draw decision boundary.
